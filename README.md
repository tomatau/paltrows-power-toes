# Paltrows Power Toes

This is a sample project used for education of React Router.

The code is organised into different branches which have progressively more complexity.

## The branches

### 1. Setup

First you can checkout the basic layout branch.

```bash
git checkout 1-setup
```

### 2. Home and About Routes

The next branch adds 2 routes with `react-router-dom`.

```bash
git checkout 2-home-and-about
```

### 3. Using Link components

We then change the navigation to use `history.pushState` via `Link` components.

```bash
git checkout 3-pushstate-navigation
```

### 4. Setup

The fourth branch adds a route for `/workouts`

```bash
git checkout 4-workouts-route
```

### 5. Setup

The last step adds the not found page

```bash
git checkout 5-not-found-route
```
